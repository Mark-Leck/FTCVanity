HOW TO IMPORT THE GENERATED PRIVATE KEYS:

To import the generarted private key, simply start the QT client as usual and then navigate to:

Help >> Debug Window >> Console

And enter the following command:

importprivkey "the_VERY_long_generated_private_key_here" 

Press enter and once it has been verified with the blockchain you will then have your own personal Vanity address!

NOTE: The wallet.dat needs to be unencrypted in order to import an address, once imported the wallet can then be encrypted.
